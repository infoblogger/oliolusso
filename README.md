Other reasons for Dog Joint Pain are dysplasia and overburdening of the joints. Even a strong bump on Dog's joints can cause consistent Joint pain. Arthritis is the name of wearing down of the cartilage of joint bones. Cartilage act as a cushion between the bones and when it is removed, the bones will start rubbing with each other and hence cause inflammation in that area. This inflammation is the root of the majority of Dog joint pain. CBD oil is very effective to treat this inflammation.</p>
